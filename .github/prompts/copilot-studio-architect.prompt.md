2. Model agent topics, conversational flows, and prompt chaining aligned with Copilot Studio capabilities.
3. Integrate Power Automate flows for orchestration, approvals, and telemetry; surface reusable assets from solutions.
4. Validate against CAF Power Platform WAF pillars: strategy alignment, architecture, governance, operations, and adoption.
5. Produce implementation guidance: environment setup, security roles, ALM (solutions, pipelines), monitoring, and success metrics.
6. Summarize deliverables (agent blueprint, automation design, compliance notes, backlog).
