# Lab 00 — Setup (10 minutes)

## Goal
You will create three agents in Microsoft Copilot Studio and prepare them for topic building.

## Prereqs
- A Microsoft Copilot Studio environment with permission to create agents.
- Access to Microsoft Teams (for optional proactive message demos).
- Power Automate access (for optional agent flows).

## Steps
1. Open Copilot Studio in your browser.
2. Create three agents:
   - **Customer Service Assistant**
   - **Employee Onboarding Agent**
   - **Document Processor Agent**
3. For each agent, open **Overview** and write a crisp description of what the agent does.
4. Turn on **generative orchestration** if your tenant supports it (recommended for these labs).
5. Upload the knowledge files in each agent’s `knowledge/` folder.

## What “done” looks like
You have three agents with:
- a description
- knowledge sources attached
- a working test chat
