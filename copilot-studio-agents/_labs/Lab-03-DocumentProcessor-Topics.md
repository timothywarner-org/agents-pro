# Lab 03 — Document Processor Agent Topics (30–45 minutes)

## Goal
Implement file classification + routing topics that work with event triggers.

## Files you will use
- `document-processor-agent/topics/T01_ClassifyAndRoute/`
- `document-processor-agent/topics/T02_ExtractMetadata/`
- `document-processor-agent/topics/T03_RequestMissingInfo/`

## Outcome
Learners can:
- accept a file-created payload
- classify the document type
- decide routing based on a CSV rule table
