# Security Policy

## Scope
This repository primarily contains instructional assets but references Microsoft 365 environments, AI Builder models, and Power Automate flows. Handle sample data and tenant identifiers carefully to protect learners and partner organizations.

## Reporting a Vulnerability
- Email **Tim Warner** at **tim@techtrainertim.com** with the subject "Security Report".
- Optionally use the contact form at <https://techtrainertim.com> if email is unavailable.
- Include reproduction steps, affected files, tenant or environment considerations, and suggested mitigations when possible.
- Expect acknowledgement within two business days and a status update within five business days.

## Guidance for Contributors
- Do not commit live tenant IDs, connection secrets, or learner personal information. Use descriptive placeholders consistent with the agent guides.
- Scrub screenshots, transcripts, and exported reports before submitting them; remove usernames, document IDs, and URL query strings.
- When documenting flows, specify required permissions and scopes without embedding confidential credentials.

## Incident Response
1. The maintainer assesses impact and coordinates with affected stakeholders.
2. Mitigations are documented in the relevant README, table, or checklist.
3. Follow-up communication summarizing corrective actions is shared with contributors involved in the report.

## Responsible Disclosure
Please keep vulnerability details confidential until remediation is complete. Coordinated communication ensures learner environments remain secure during live deliveries.
